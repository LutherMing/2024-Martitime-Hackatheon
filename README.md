## Problem Statement:

#### Background:
- International shipping contributes 3% of global annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, equivalent to Japan's emissions.
- The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) aims for net zero GHG emissions from shipping.
- The Maritime Port Authority (MPA) of Singapore launched the Maritime Singapore Green Initiative to reduce environmental impact.

#### Objective:
- Develop a baseline assessment of GHG emissions at Singapore ports.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of electrification in reducing GHG emissions.

#### Key Questions:
1. Is electrification an effective method for reducing GHG emissions?
2. How much can GHG emissions be reduced through electrification?
3. What is the variation in electrical load demand between daytime and nighttime?

#### Ports of Interest:
- Pasir Panjang Terminal (Category A – University Level)
- Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore (Category B – Junior College and Polytechnic Level)

#### Data Sources:
- AIS movement data of vessels from August to September 2023 + Vessel characteristics.
- Polygon data of the port.
- Methodology for calculating emissions.
